# Distribution

* Upstream: https://github.com/distribution/distribution
* Dependencies: golang, base

Provides a statically compiled version of distribution, an open source Docker/OCI registry.

NB: Last stable release is two years old and predates the repo change from `docker/distribution` to
`distribution/distribution`. Future releases will require manual Dockerfile changes.
