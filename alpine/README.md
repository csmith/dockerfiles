# Alpine Linux

* Upstream: https://alpinelinux.org/
* Dependencies: none

Image corresponding to the latest stable "Mini root filesystem" release of Arch Linux.

In order to verify the sha256 sum of the downloaded filesystem, the build process
actually depends on this image. If starting a fresh registry, the image will need
to be bootstrapped from a manual build.
