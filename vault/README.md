# Hashicorp Vault

* Upstream: https://github.com/hashicorp/vault
* Dependencies: golang, base

The latest stable version of Vault, compiled from source.

Does not include the Vault UI as the static resources are not shipped pre-compiled, and it takes about 50x longer to
compile those than it does to build the actual server.
